# Textbook Project
### Structure and API
* Getting into the meat and bones of the project. This will be the area that the API calls of the project are born. Hopefully we should be able to return things such as Name:Key pairs for catalogs, books, sections and be able to get and post such details.
* Todo:
  * Make tables for Catalog, Book, and Section.
  * Make form for viewing *but not modifying* these three tables
   This will take api calls for the aforementioned <key:name> pairs of the relevant tables. We should be able to query the api for specific catalogs, books, ect.
  * Make for for viewing *and modifying* above.
